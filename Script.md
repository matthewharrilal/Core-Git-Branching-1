# The Unicorn Kingdom

## Synopsis


A young boy discovers a hidden gate behind the zoo.


## Plot



Being on time was not one of The King Of All’s specialities today would prove to be no different.
As he mooved slowly.

As he walked behind the zoo he could see the trees and thick foliage growing above the heavy stone wall that ran behind the zoo; and hear the sounds of animals in the distance.
The King Of All had heard the sound before, but today there was a new sound, sort of a cross between an angelic horn and an elephant’s trumpet.
