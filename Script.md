# The Unicorn Kingdom

## Synopsis


A young boy discovers a hidden gate behind the zoo.


## Plot



Being on time was not one of The King Of All’s specialities today would prove to be no different.
As he mooved slowly.

As he walked behind the zoo he could see the trees and thick foliage growing above the heavy stone wall that ran behind the zoo; and hear the sounds of animals in the distance.
The King Of All had heard the sound before, but today there was a new sound, sort of a cross between an angelic horn and an elephant’s trumpet.
Taking that sound he applies his new superpowers to better the world. At the same time he throws this super awesome dance party and then the rest is history. And by the way did I mention that when life hands you lemons you always want to make lemonade!

But then all of a sudden the zookeeper then comes in. He says who here is going to pay the rent for me today and all of a sudden I wonder what it means to be financially stable. It all makes sense now! As I pull out the major bankrolls from the bank I robbed yesterday I then wonder how fast can I run
